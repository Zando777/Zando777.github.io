      "description": "As part of a university module challenge, I worked in a team of four to design and build a mobile manipulator under strict resource constraints, limited to a £50 budget and a defined set of components. Our solution was a mecanum-wheeled robot equipped with a 3-DOF arm, ultrasonic sensors, and line-following sensors, enabling it to autonomously navigate through gates, follow a track, and precisely draw a cross on a whiteboard.\n\nDespite the tight limitations, we delivered the fastest, most repeatable, and most reliable robot in our cohort—and even outperformed previous years’ teams tackling the same challenge. The robot consistently executed the full brief with complete autonomy, showcasing not only robust design but also strong teamwork, problem-solving, and optimization under constraints.",

      "description": "I've spent most of my life immersed in the world of FPV drones—an obsession that started when I built my first quadcopter at 13. From that shaky maiden flight (captured on video as both the first and last flight of that airframe) to designing, building, and tuning high-performance racing drones and cinematic rigs, I've continuously pushed the limits of what's possible with custom UAVs. Over the years, I've refined my skills in electronics, aerodynamics, radio systems, and flight control tuning, mastering the balance between raw speed, precision handling, and silky-smooth cinematic capture. Whether ripping through racetracks at high-G turns or choreographing aerial shots that feel like they belong in a film, FPV drones have been my testbed for engineering creativity, hands-on problem solving, and precision piloting—skills that directly fuel my approach to robotics and automation today.",

      "description": "For my final year dissertation, I tackled one of the biggest challenges in modern aerospace manufacturing: how to get fleets of autonomous mobile robots working together to transport massive aerostructures. Partnering with Airbus and the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), I designed and implemented a novel peer-to-peer relative positioning system using only low-cost 2D LiDAR sensors—eliminating the need for expensive infrastructure or heavy computation. My system, built on ROS, Gazebo, and Python, enabled robots to identify each other, coordinate in formation, and navigate dynamic, obstacle-filled environments with centimetre-level accuracy. Tested in both simulation and on Clearpath Dingo robots, the work demonstrated a scalable and flexible solution that paves the way for Airbus to boost aircraft production efficiency through smarter, more adaptable automation.",

The aim was to increase flight times to enable long range missions while retaining the extremely high maneuverability of a non-fixed wing multirotor. These dynamics would enable use cases in offshore wind, medical aid delivery, and military among many others. The team developed the airframe, wings, electronics and avionics, and control.

      "description": "This project is a solar water heating optimization system that combines IoT hardware with reinforcement learning to intelligently control water circulation between solar water panels and a water storage tank. Temperature sensors monitor the system's conditions, while an Arduino Mega handles data collection, water pump relay control, and temperature and pump status outputs on a screen. An ESP32 bridges the hardware to an MQTT broker running on a laptop, where Python scripts process sensor data and apply an RL agent that learns the most efficient pump operation strategies. By integrating external factors such as time of day and weather forecasts through APIs, the system not only reacts to current conditions but also anticipates changes, improving energy efficiency and maximizing the use of solar heating. A simulator/digital twin is being developed to allow testing and training the RL agent without hardware, accelerating development and ensuring robustness before real-world deployment. The aim here is to test the efficacy of a RL system on a graspable real world control problem and see if it can produce improved control methods, thus improving the energy harnessed from the sun and reducing pump power consumption.",

The idea is to have a helper robot to assist with retrieving and delivering tools to me when I'm working underneath my car. The platform integrates 2D LiDAR and camera-based perception for object detection and environmental awareness.\n\nThe rover's drive system repurposes motors from hoverboards, with STM32-based ESCs re-flashed to accept control commands from an Arduino (or equivalent) using the SimpleFOC library to achieve precise closed-loop motor control. Custom mecanum wheels replace standard tires to enable omnidirectional movement.\n\nI have begun the CAD design of the robot, as well as the design of a custom stepper driver board, including end-stop and encoder integration, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, and power step-down circuitry. On the software side, I have deployed YOLO object recognition on a Raspberry Pi 5 and am working to integrate voice command comprehension through a large language model. The complete system is planned to operate under ROS 2 to unify perception, control, and motion planning. This project is ongoing and was started in August 2025.",

A key challenge I've identified in robot dogs is accurately quantifying the force on each foot, which is essential for tuning control systems to achieve running, jumping, and other dynamic motions.\n\nTo explore this problem without building a full robot dog—which requires twelve actuators (three per leg) and is prohibitively expensive—I developed a paw-level sensing prototype. I embedded a Hall effect sensor into a paw structure, with a flexible TPU \"paw pad\" containing a magnet that deflects under load toward the sensor. I characterized the system by correlating Hall effect readings with the applied force, measured using a scale and a leg stand, to understand the compression behavior of the TPU pad under load.\n\nThis work forms the foundation for future development, and once sufficient resources are available, I plan to integrate this sensing system into a full quadruped platform.",

      "description": "I developed a novel wire tensioning system concept as part of R&D efforts to improve electric motor precision winding. The existing winding method relied on short lengths of wire that required frequent replacement, disrupting the process and reducing efficiency. My goal was to enable the use of continuous spools of winding wire while maintaining precise and controlled tension, a critical factor in high-quality stator and coil production.\n\nThe concept employed a custom field-oriented controlled (FOC) closed-loop stepper motor to deliver finely regulated torque, which in turn modulated the force applied by a spring-based tensioning mechanism. This approach provided a dynamic, accurate means of maintaining wire tension. I successfully validated the idea through testing of the closed-loop motor system paired with an AS5600 magnetic rotary encoder.\n\nBeyond control validation, I designed a full preliminary CAD model of the tensioning assembly. This project highlighted the potential of applying advanced motor control strategies in manufacturing R&D.",

      "description": "I designed a Rotary Variable Differential Transformer (RVDT) signal conditioning board for application in electric aerospace systems. Using the datasheet of the AD598 signal conditioning IC as my primary reference, I derived the required circuit architecture and selected the passive components to achieve the intended signal processing characteristics. This process demanded careful interpretation of the IC specifications and mathematical modeling of the circuit to ensure the intended function of the RVDT.\n\nTo validate the design, I first constructed a breadboard prototype, which allowed me to test the circuit's functionality and refine component values before committing to fabrication. Following successful bench testing, I designed and produced a custom PCB, ensuring reliable performance and seamless integration with the existing aerospace electronics stack.\n\nThis project gave me end-to-end experience in electronics design — from schematic development and component selection, through prototyping and debugging, to final PCB production. It also reinforced the importance of datasheet interpretation, practical testing, and iterative development when engineering circuits for high-reliability aerospace applications.",

      "description": "While studying in England, I noticed how much of a difference sunlight made to my daily routine and wanted a way to optimize natural light in my room. This led me to design and build an ESP32-based smart blind actuator that could intelligently open and close my blinds. The system interfaced with my smart lighting setup to ensure my room was always lit when I was home, allowed me to close blinds remotely if I had forgotten, and ensured I woke up with natural light whenever possible.\n\nThe device used a geared stepper motor mechanically coupled to the blinds, replacing one of the existing mounts and the pull chain. An ESP32 microcontroller managed control logic and integrated with Amazon Alexa, enabling scheduling, voice control, and full integration into my home automation system.\n\nThis project combined mechanical design, embedded programming, and IoT integration, resulting in a practical device that enhanced everyday comfort through small-scale automation.",

      "description": "This project was developed to streamline the process of generating Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) codes for parts designed in Solid Edge, after identifying significant inefficiencies in the manual workflow. The solution leverages optical character recognition (OCR) to extract key characteristics directly from Solid Edge draft files, which are then processed through an Excel VBA script to automatically return the appropriate SRM code to the user's clipboard.\n\nBy automating what was previously a manual task—taking several minutes per drawing and repeated multiple times daily—the system enables rapid identification of the most cost-effective stock materials for manufacturing each assembly component.\n\nThe project was later expanded to include retrospective analysis of the Product Data Management (PDM) system, cataloguing material information for existing product designs. This effort produced a comprehensive materials library that can be integrated with the PDM system, significantly improving the efficiency of managing legacy seals, and saving tens of man hours monthly.",
